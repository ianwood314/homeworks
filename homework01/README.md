## Three Basic Python Programs

This repository contains three independent Python exercises:
 1. odd_or_even.py - displays on the screen which numbers in a list are even and which are odd
 2. list_primes.py - lists all primes between two ints n and m inclusive
 3. three_lists.py - prints each list in column format side by side on the terminal screen
